It captures two aspects of your project:
1. **Structure**: The hierarchical relationship between folders and files.
2. **Content**: The actual text contents of files, including code, plain text, markdown, etc.

## What You See Is What You Get ðŸ‘€
This tool follows a simple and intuitive principle:

- If a folder is expanded and visible, its structure is included by default.
- You can manually select items for exclusion or choose whether to include a file's contents.

## Security
All code is client-side and nothing is uploaded to a server.
